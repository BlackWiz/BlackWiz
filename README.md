## ‚ú® Featured Projects

### üß† Custom Preemptive RTOS Kernel from Scratch
This project is a deep dive into operating system design, involving the creation of a lightweight, preemptive RTOS kernel for **ARM Cortex-M** microcontrollers. The goal was to understand and implement the core mechanics of a modern real-time operating system, including task scheduling, context switching, and inter-process communication.
More details & updates to be added soon!!!
